In humans, substituting meat with tempeh can improve cognitive health indirectly through better cardiovascular profile.","Tempeh is rich in protein and contains all essential amino acids. Fermentation reduces soyÃ¢ÂÂs phytic acid and increases mineral bioavailability (zinc, iron). It has been linked to improved cholesterol levels, likely due to soy protein and bioactive peptides formed during fermentation. Also high in isoflavones, supporting bone health and possibly easing menopause symptoms. Because itÃ¢ÂÂs usually made with a fungus (Rhizopus) that produces enzymes, tempeh is easier to digest and might cause less bloating than unfermented soy.

However, it is a good plant protein that, when replacing animal protein, improves cardiovascular health. Cognitive benefit comes mainly from its isoflavones; some studies show improved memory in postmenopausal women on soy isoflavones. Also, a diet including tofu instead of red meat means lower saturated fat, supporting better brain vascular health.","Tofu is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fat, and a solid source of protein, iron, and calcium (if calcium-set). Regular consumption can lower LDL and is associated with lower risk of breast and prostate cancers (especially when started in adolescence for breast). There were old myths about tofu and cognitive impairment in some observational studies in men Ã¢ÂÂ likely confounded by factors like formaldehyde use in some tofu preservation historically.
